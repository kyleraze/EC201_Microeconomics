The purpose of this course is to cultivate your economic intuition. My goal is not to teach you *what to think*, but rather *how to think* as economists. We will consider how social outcomes are shaped by the decisions of many individuals, even though each individual commands only a small fraction of the economy. Expanding upon the notion that individuals respond to incentives, we will use models to analyze and assess a variety of social phenomena. Successful students will leave the course with an intellectual framework for understanding and evaluating economic issues and policy.
